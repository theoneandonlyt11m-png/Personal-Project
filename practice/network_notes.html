         Protocol - set of rules that regulate how computers sent and recieve data.
         
         Packet -  a small, formatted chunk of data sent over a network, 
         containing both the actual data and crucial control information.
         like the source and destination addresses.
         
         Header - the control information at the beginning 
         of a data packet, containing metadata like the source 
         and destination IP addresses, packet length, and version.
         
         Payload -  the actual data being sent over a network.
         
         Router - a networking device that connects local networks

        <h2>Problems we faced</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Middle table had the most work.</li>
            <li>Nobody knew where is the destinations.</li>
            <li>Most packets didn't end up in the final place.</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Solutions</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>We made maps.</li>
            <li>We added information to the packet, like which piece of the packet it is, and from and to.</li>
         </ul>
